# AI Code Generation System for Feature Enhancements

## Overview

The AI Code Generation System is designed to automate the generation of code changes and unit tests based on enhancement requests described in Jira tickets. By leveraging natural language processing and AI models, the system interprets user requirements and produces functional code that adheres to specified acceptance criteria.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Parses enhancement requests from Jira tickets.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates code changes in the specified programming language.
- **Unit Test Generation**: Creates meaningful unit tests that cover typical and edge cases.
- **Code Quality**: Ensures high code quality and maintainability.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask (for a web interface)
- **AI Model**: OpenAI's GPT-3 or similar for natural language processing
- **Testing Framework**: pytest
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Dependency Management**: pip and requirements.txt

## System Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture, where different components handle specific tasks. The main components include:

- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web application for user interaction.
- **NLP Module**: Responsible for parsing natural language descriptions.
- **Code Generation Module**: Generates code based on parsed requirements.
- **Testing Module**: Creates unit tests to ensure code correctness.

## Components

### Natural Language Processing

The NLP module utilizes an AI model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3) to parse enhancement requests. It extracts key information such as:

- Feature description
- Expected behaviors
- Acceptance criteria

This information is then structured for the code generation module.

### Code Generation

The code generation module takes the structured information from the NLP module and produces:

- Code changes required to implement the feature.
- A complete code diff that can be applied to the existing codebase.

The generated code adheres to best practices and is designed for maintainability.

### Unit Test Generation

The testing module generates unit tests that cover:

- Typical use cases
- Edge cases

These tests are created using a testing framework (pytest) and are designed to ensure that the generated code functions as expected.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
